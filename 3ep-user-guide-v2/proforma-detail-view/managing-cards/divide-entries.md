### **Divide Entries**

#### About Divide Cards

After time and cost entries have been included in a proforma, the worked and billed hours on the original entry can be divided. The purpose of dividing time and/or cost entries is to exclude them from the proforma, or to partially purge a record.

Calculated charge entries, i.e., taxes, interest, BOA, flat fees, markups, etc., cannot be divided; however, charge entries entered directly, i.e., as anticipated time/costs, etc, can be divided in the same manner as time and cost entries. One or multiple entries can be created for the divided amounts. The original entry is changed to the new reduced value. In addition, the divided entries can be optionally transferred to another proforma.

 

#### Divide Cards

Do the following to flag a card to be divided. Divided cards can be moved to another proforma, kept on the current proforma, or purged.

**Note:** Whether the 3E Proforma action of Divide is automatically loaded into 3E in Proforma Edit depends on the “Commit_cardactions” setting in core 3E. If the setting is set to **False**, a biller will be required to review and finalize the Divide action in Proforma Edit by clicking on ProcTransfer or ProcExlude action. If the setting is set to **True**, the Divide action is performed automatically in 3E Proforma on the Save & recalc/Save & close/Submit actions.

1.  Locate the proforma containing funds on the Proforma list.

2.  Click the proforma number to access the Proforma Details view.

3.  Click the appropriate tab (i.e., Fees, Costs, or Charge).

4.  Click the card-level **Action** menu for a listed card and select **Divide**.

**Note**: The **Divide** option is not available on the card list batch-Action menu.

5.  Select settings to apply when the card is divided. See [Divide Card Form and Field Definitions](#divide-card-form-and-field-definitions) for details.

**Note**: Options available on the Divide form will vary by card type.

6.  Click **Divide**.

7.  Click **Save & Close**.
