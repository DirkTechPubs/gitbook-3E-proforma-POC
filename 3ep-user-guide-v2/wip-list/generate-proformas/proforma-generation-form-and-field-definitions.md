### **Proforma Generation Form and Field Definitions**

The Proforma Generation form is used to configure settings for creating proformas for matters in the [<u>WIP list</u>](../wip-list-form-and-field-definitions.md#wip-list-form-and-field-definitions). This form is accessed when the Generation action is initiated from the WIP List for one or more listed matters.

<td><strong>Update proforma status for proformas without WIP</strong></td>
